# Consul on OpenShift

Consul supports integration with OpenShift. You can deploy Consul to OpenShift using the [Helm chart](/consul/docs/k8s/installation/install#helm-chart-installation) or [Consul K8s CLI](/consul/docs/k8s/installation/install-cli#consul-k8s-cli-installation), sync services between Consul and OpenShift, run Consul Service Mesh, and more.
This section documents the official integrations between Consul and OpenShift.

## Use Cases

**Consul Service Mesh**: 
Consul can automatically inject the [Consul Service Mesh](/consul/docs/connect) sidecar into pods so that they can accept and establish encrypted and authorized network connections with mutual TLS. And because Consul Service Mesh can run anywhere, pods and external services can communicate with each other over a fully encrypted connection.

**Service sync to enable OpenShift and non-OpenShift services to communicate**: 
Consul can sync OpenShift services with its own service registry. This service sync allows OpenShift services to use OpenShiftâ€™s native service discovery capabilities to discover and connect to external services registered in Consul, and for external services to use Consul service discovery to discover and connect to OpenShift services.

**Additional integrations**:
Consul can run directly on OpenShift, so in addition to the native integrations provided by Consul itself, any other tool built for OpenShift can leverage Consul.

## Getting Started With Consul and OpenShift

There are several ways to try Consul with OpenShift in different environments.

### Tutorials

- The [Getting Started with Consul Service Mesh track](/consul/tutorials/archive/kubernetes-openshift-red-hat) provides guidance for installing Consul as service mesh on a local instance of OpenShift using the Helm chart, deploying services in the service mesh, and using intentions to secure service communications.

- The [Migrate to Microservices with Consul Service Mesh on Kubernetes](/consul/tutorials/microservices?utm_source=docs) collection uses an example application written by a fictional company to illustrate why and how organizations can migrate from monolith to microservices using Consul service mesh. The case study in this collection should provide information valuable for understanding how to develop services that leverage Consul during any stage of your microservices journey.

- Since OpenShift is a certified Kubernetes powered application platform, the [Consul and Kubernetes Reference Architecture](/consul/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-reference-architecture?utm_source=docs) guide is relevant and provides recommended practices for production.

- The [Secure Consul and Registered Services on Kubernetes](/consul/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-secure-agents?utm_source=docs) tutorial covers the necessary steps to secure a Consul cluster running on a Kubernetes in production, which also applies to an OpenShift deployment.

- The [Layer 7 Observability with Consul Service Mesh](/consul/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-layer7-observability) tutorial covers monitoring a Consul service mesh running on an OpenShift-like microservices platform with Prometheus and Grafana.

### Documentation

- [Installing Consul](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/platform/openshift) covers how to deploy Consul on an OpenShift environment using the Helm chart.

- [Helm Chart Reference](/consul/docs/k8s/helm) describes the different options for configuring the Helm chart.
